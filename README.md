# Binary Prediction of Poisonous Mushrooms

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify mushrooms as either poisonous or edible based on their physical characteristics. Using a dataset containing features such as cap shape, gill color, and spore print color, the model aims to accurately predict the toxicity of a mushroom. The goal is to provide a reliable tool for distinguishing between safe and dangerous mushrooms, leveraging the power of data science.

The project involves exploring various classification algorithms, including ensemble methods like RandomForest, XGBoost, and GradientBoosting, to achieve the highest possible accuracy. By evaluating and comparing these models, the project highlights the effectiveness of different approaches in solving binary classification problems. This work can be particularly useful for foragers, researchers, and enthusiasts in the field of mycology.
